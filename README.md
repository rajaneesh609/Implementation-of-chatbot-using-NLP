# Edubot - Your Educational Assistant ðŸ¤–

EduBot is an AI-driven educational assistant that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), PyTorch, Python, and Streamlit to create an interactive learning platform. It uses NLP to understand student queries and generate accurate, personalized responses while leveraging PyTorch for deep learning-based recommendations. Streamlit powers the user-friendly interface, making EduBot accessible and engaging for students across various subjects.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the MediBot project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository  
   ```bash
   git <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Linux/Mac  source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download NLTK Data
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

---

## Usage
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run Edubot.py
```

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

---

## Intents Data
The chatbot's behavior is defined by the `intents.json` file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones for your cahtbot.

---

## Conversation History
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (`chat_log.csv`). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.
