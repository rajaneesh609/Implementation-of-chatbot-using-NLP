# MediBot - Your Medical Assistant 🤖

MediBot is a medical chatbot designed to provide quick responses to common health-related queries. Built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, MediBot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Logistic Regression for intent-based response generation. It offers a user-friendly interface and logs conversations for review.

---

## Features

- **Intent-based Response Generation:**  
  MediBot interprets user queries using NLP techniques and give responses based on predefined intents.

- **Conversation Logging:**  
  User queries and chatbot responses are logged with timestamps for review and analysis.

- **Streamlit-powered Interface:**  
  A simple and interactive web application interface that allows seamless interaction.

- **Expandable Design:**  
  Easy to enhance with additional intents or features such as advanced AI-based responses.

## How It Works

1. **Ask Questions:**  
   Users type their health-related queries into the input box on the "Home" screen.

2. **Receive Responses:**  
   MediBot analyzes the input and provides a text-based response.

3. **Review History:**  
   Users can review the conversation history in the "Conversation History" section, which displays all previous interactions.

4. **Learn More About MediBot:**  
   The "About" section provides an overview of the chatbot’s purpose and features.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the MediBot project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository  
   ```bash
   git <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download NLTK Data
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

---

## Usage
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:
```bash
python -m streamlit run MediBot.py
```

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

---

## Intents Data
The chatbot's behavior is defined by the `intents.json` file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones for your cahtbot.

---

## Conversation History
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (`chat_log.csv`). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.
